                    <h3>II.	ACADEMIC PROJECT EXPERIENCE</h3>
                    <p>    •	Designed multi-agent based autonomous bots that interact with each other via optimization algorithm such as Genetic Algorithm, tree search algorithms such as DFS, Hill Climbing, A* search, Simulated Annealing as well as another modified Simulated Annealing algorithm in a game environment inducing emergent behaviors. Some scenarios of the behavior of ghost agents using Hill Climbing algorithm, Simulated Annealing and another Simulated Annealing inspired algorithm to reach their adversary are uploaded online. The link is as follows: <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKvz4TrcLS8 target="_blank">Online video.</a>  </p>
                    <p>         <a href=https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bra2UyB2gKgMw target="_blank">Link to its corresponding thesis' slide presentation.</a>  </p>
                    <p>    •	Designed and modeled non parametric machine learning classifier called Naïve Bayes classifier as well Kernel classifier for Multivariate Feature classification. Special emphasis was given to three cases, ie. (a) Feature covariance where non diagonal elements are null, or independent covariant features with gaussian assumption, (b) Feature covariance where diagonal elements are not zero, that is dependent covariant features with non-Gaussian assumption.  </p>
                    <p>    •	Designed Lindenmayer system based Neuro-evolutionary Network for diverse niche in population which is a biologically inspired neuroevolution technique with synaptic neuron constraint using Lindenmayer System with memory that helps to implement modularity and hierarchy, ie. recursive use of same substructure and modular decomposition of problem used in making an intrusion detection.</p>
                    <p>    •	Designed Dynamic Neuron Architecture based on Neuro evolutionary Network for diverse topologies. This classifier algorithm is a direct encoded heuristic based neuroevolution technique with connection constraints where heuristic based mutation and crossover operators of node addition, deletion and crossover of nodes among best individuals that optimize a network. </p>
                    <p>    •	Designed Self organizing Network, Local Area Network and Wide Area Network architecture. </p>
